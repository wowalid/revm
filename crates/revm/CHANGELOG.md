# v2.0.0
date: 10.09.2022

Release with `Database` interface changed, execution result, consensus bug fixes and support for all past forks. Additional optimizations on evm initialization.

Main changes:
* Add support for old forks. (#191) (9 days ago)
* revm/evm: Return `ExecutionResult`, which includes `gas_refunded` (#169) (4 weeks ago) <Nicolas Gotchac>
* JournaledState (#175)
    * Optimize handling of precompiles. Initialization and account loading.
    * Fixes SELFDESTRUCT bug.
* Optimize calldataload. Some cleanup (#168)
* Handle HighNonce tests (#176)

* chore(ci): use ethtests profile for CI tests (#188) (2 weeks ago) <Alexey Shekhirin>
* Bump dependencies version
* current_opcode fn and rename program_counter to instruction_pointer (#211)
* Cfg choose create analysis, option on bytecode size limit (#210)
* Cleanup remove U256 and use u64 for gas calculation (#213)

Consensus bugs:
* SELFDESTRUCT was not handled correctly. It would remove account/storage but it should just mark it for removal. This bug was here from earlier version of revm. (#175)
* fix: set gas_block to empty bytecode (#172). Introduced in v1.8.0 with bytecode format.

# v1.9.0
date: 09.08.2022

Small release. Optimizations

* Cache bytecode hash
* Move override_spec config from Inspector to cfg

# v1.8.0
date: 01.08.2022

Medium release, good performance boost. Database trait has changed to support Bytecode.

* Introduce Bytecode format (#156)
* Update readme files.

# v1.7.0
date: 11.06.2022

small release:

# v1.6.0
date: 02.06.2022

Most changes are relayed to CacheDB and how it saved accounts.

* Introduce account `Touched/Cleared/None` state in CacheDB
* Add missing inspectors `call_end` calls
* bump dependencies and few standard derives.

# v1.5.0
date: 09.06.2022

Consensus error related to gas block optimization and `sstore` min stipend. Solution is to make `sstore` instruction as `gas_block_end` as to not spend future instruction gas when checking min stipend condition introduced in EIP-2200.

* Consensus error with gas block for SSTORE stipend check (#124)
* enable EIP2200 in Istanbul (#125)

# v1.4.1
date: 06.06.2022

Small release:
* chore: export evm_inner (#122)

date: 03.06.2022

Small release:
* fix: BLOCKHASH should return 0 if number not in last 256 blocks (#112)

* bump some lib versions.

# v1.3.1
date: 11.4.2022

Small fixes release.
* Empty keccak constant and remove access_list.clone (#111)
* chore: typo fixes
* fix is_static for Inspector initialize_interp

# v1.3.0
date: 30.4.2022

There are a lot of big changes that are included in this release as revm was integrated inside foundry.

* A lot of changed on Inspector, added new calls and flushed out how it should be called. Big effort mostly driven by Oliver Nordbjerg
* Big internal refactor and renaming: Machine->Inspector, call/create info are now in structs.
* feat: add serde support to model types. Thank you Matthias Seitz
* Added rust feature that sets memory limit on interpreter that is configurable with env.cfg. by Oliver Nordbjerg.
* Library bumped to higher version.

# v1.2.0
date 20.1.2022

Changes:
* Bump revm_precompile and added new feature for k256 lib.

# v1.1.0
date: 14.1.2022

There is bug introduced in last release with gas blcok optimization, it will crash revm if anywhere in contract is unknown OpCode. And now returning log after execution (ups) included them in eth/tests verification.

Changes:
* Bug fix for unknown OpCode
* Omit edgecase high nonce test. tracer gas fix 
* Some internal cleanup

# v1.0.0
date: 18.12.2021

It feel's like that the lib is in the state that is okay to promote it to the v1 version. Other that that, a lot of optimizations are done and the inspector trait was rewritten.

Changes: 
*  web3 db
*  precalculated gas blocks. Optimization
*  PC opcode as pointer. Optimization
*  U256 div_rem optimization
*  Inspector refactored and it is now closer to Host interface.

Optimization thread: https://github.com/bluealloy/revm/issues/7


# v0.5.0
date: 17.11.2021

A lot of optimization on machine(Interpreter) part, it is now at least 3x faster. On interface side, Error enum was renamed to Return and it is simplified. Additionally if needed gas measuring can be removed with rust feature.

Changes: 
* push instruction optimized.
* mload/mstore and memory optimized
* Gas calculation optimized
* optimize i256
* switch stacks from H256 with U256
* Error's refactor to Return
* clippy/warnings/fmt cleanup
* Bump auto_impl to v0.5
* opcode renaming
* Gas measurment can be removed with rust features.

# v0.4.1
date: 02.11.2021

Change in interface and how you can call evm. There is now multiple Database traits for use and inspector is taken on transact call as reference.

* 20ac70b - Database traits made useful.
* 46b5bcd - EVM Interface changed. Inspector called separately.


# v0.3.1

### 17.10.2021:
-For past few weeks working on this structure and project in general become really good and I like it. For me it surved as good distraction for past few weeks and i think i am going to get drained if i continue working on it, so i am taking break and i intend to come back after few months and finish it.
- For status:
    * machine/spec/opcodes/precompiles(without modexp) feels good and I probably dont need to touch them.
    * inspector: is what i wanted, full control on insides of EVM so that we can control it and modify it. will probably needs to add some small tweaks to interface but nothing major.
    * subroutines: Feels okay but it needs more scrutiny just to be sure that all corner cases are covered.
    * Test that are failing (~20) are mostly related to EIP-158: State clearing. For EIP-158 I will time to do it properly.
    * There is probably benefit of replaing HashMap hasher with something simpler, but this is research for another time.
